# Grokking Algorithms Practice

This repo is for practicing problems and exercises from the **Grokking Algorithms** book.

I'm using it to build a strong foundation in common and necessary data structures and algorithms so I can eventually tackle LeetCode problems more confidently.

I haven’t taken a data structures class yet, so this repo is my way of learning the basics on my own.
